  <h1>Ice Skating</h1>

  <p>I learned to ice skate at Rockefeller Center in New York City in 2015 and have been skating regularly ever since. Ice skating is difficult. There are so many things to learn, and I have fallen and hurt myself so many times. But it is also fun and rewarding. There is nothing as satisfying as the feeling I get when I can finally do the trick I have been working on for so long.</p>

  <h1>Stargazing</h1>

  <p>I love watching the stars and contemplating our place in the universe. What is out there? Are we alone? Can we go there? I like the idea that I see the same stars as our ancestors did millennia ago, and I wonder if they asked themselves the same questions. It still blows my mind that there is a planet with giant rings floating out there in space.</p>

  <p>I own an Orion SpaceProbe 130ST, a 5.1â€³ aperture reflector telescope. I also go to free public events organized by the <a href="https://orion.stanford.edu">Stanford Astronomical Society</a> and <a href="https://foothill.edu/astronomy/observatory.html">Foothill College Observatory</a>.</p>

  <h1>Blood Donation</h1>

  <p>I donated blood for the first time on my birthday. I was challenging myself; On this birthday, I wanted to do something that I had never done before in my life, something that would help other people.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, I was scared. I thought that it must really hurt. But after I did it, the first thought that came to my mind was "Is that all?" The process went quick. The only time that I hurt was when the nurse put the needle in. But that felt like nothing more than an ant bite. After that, I did not feel anything.</p>

  <p>But the feeling that came after the donation was joy. It felt really good to know that my blood would be used to save someone's life. The nurse had me sit with other donors afterwards to make sure that I was well. I told them that I was a first timer and asked them how many times they had donated. One told me it was their 40th. Another said they had lost count. Before I donated blood, I would not have believed it. But now I could see why. I have been donating blood regularly ever since.</p>
